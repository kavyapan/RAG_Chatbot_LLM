# Book Recommendation Chatbot_RAG_LLM 


### [1.A book assistant chatbot using Python,embedding-based retrieval strategies, and GPT-2](https://github.com/kavyapan/RAG_Chatbot_LLM/blob/main/RAG_Chatbot_BookRecommendation.ipynb) 
This project is a simple book recommendation chatbot designed to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their queries. The chatbot leverages a combination of Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings of book descriptions and GPT-2 for generating human-like conversational responses. Additionally, it uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient similarity search and retrieval of book embeddings.

#### Features
**1. Book Embedding Storage**: Utilizes Sentence Transformers to encode book descriptions into embeddings.  
**2. Efficient Retrieval with FAISS**: Uses FAISS for fast and efficient similarity search to match user queries with relevant book embeddings.  
**3. Conversational Responses**: Employs GPT-2 to generate natural language responses, enhancing user interaction.  
**4. Interactive Chatbot**: Offers an interactive interface for users to input their preferences and receive book recommendations.  

#### Data
The [book_summaries.txt](https://github.com/kavyapan/RAG_Chatbot_LLM/blob/main/book_summaries.txt) is downloaded from the [CMU Book Summary Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ymaricar/cmu-book-summary-dataset).  
For ease of use, this data is processed and saved into [book.json](https://github.com/kavyapan/RAG_Chatbot_LLM/blob/main/book.json).
