# Chatbot with LLM and RAG  
A book assistant chatbot using Python, LangChain, embedding-based retrieval strategies, and GPT-2.

The [book corpus](https://github.com/kavyapan/RAG_Chatbot_LLM/blob/main/book_summaries.txt) is based on the [CMU Book Summary Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ymaricar/cmu-book-summary-dataset).  
For ease of use, the data is processed and saved into book.json. If you prefer, you can download the original CMU Book Summary Corpus and parse it as well.
